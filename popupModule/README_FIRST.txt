Assumptions & Comments
-----------------------

* As indicated in point 2, this is a rectangle, but the accompanying picture is in my opinion a square. As such i am moving the popup
around the circle while maintaining the said dimensions, and not rotating the popup itself in conjunction.

* As indicated in point 5, i am using css classes to rotate the popup, named after the orientations specified. If i was tasked
to produce this module in another situation, i would prefer to do these calculations dynamically and not have a dependency on 
CSS as instructed.

* I have produced this module in a manner i might do for a prototype or initial version. I was told by the recruiter the task should
take around 45minutes, i spent roughly 2hours to produce the package, so i didn’t include any unit tests or in depth sanity checking as i
would for production code because i was already "over". Some of the code i have left in place also to give you an idea of my train of thought.

* I did enjoy the task :) I have spent alot of time lately responsive design so it was nice to get dirty in some more in depth JS again!
